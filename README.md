## Usage Instructions

### **The Two-stage Method**

To run the **population growth** example, execute the following command, choosing a path to store the plot with the results and final trained model weights:

```
python 2Stage/logPopulation.py --savePlot "path/to/save/plot" --saveModel "path/to/save/model"
```

To run the **chemical reaction** example, execute the following command, choosing a path to store the plot with the results and final trained model weights:

```
python 2Stage/chemicalReaction.py --savePlot "path/to/save/plot" --saveModel "path/to/save/model"
```

There are more options that can be chosen, such as the number of iterations, data size, numerical method, etc. Check the options in the logPopulation.py and chemicalReaction.py files.
